Modern quantum theory  developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,   and  digital computers  emerged in the following decades to replace  human computers  for tedious calculations.  Both disciplines had practical applications during  World War II ; computers played a major role in  wartime cryptography ,  and quantum physics was essential for  nuclear physics  used in the  Manhattan Project .   As  physicists  applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital  bits  for  qubits , the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980,  Paul Benioff  introduced the  quantum Turing machine , which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.  When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an  exponential  increase in overhead when  simulating quantum dynamics ,  prompting  Yuri Manin  and  Richard Feynman  to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.    In a 1984 paper,  Charles Bennett  and  Gilles Brassard  applied quantum theory to  cryptography  protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance  information security .    Quantum algorithms  then emerged for solving  oracle problems , such as  Deutsch's algorithm  in 1985,  the  Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm  in 1993,  and  Simon's algorithm  in 1994.  These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a  black box  with a quantum state in  superposition , sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.   Peter Shor  built on these results with  his 1994 algorithm  for breaking the widely used  RSA  and  Diffie–Hellman  encryption protocols,  which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996,  Grover's algorithm  established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable  unstructured  search problem.   The same year,  Seth Lloyd   proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,  validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.   Over the years,  experimentalists  have constructed small-scale quantum computers using  trapped ions   and superconductors.  In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,   and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.   In 2019,  Google AI  and  NASA  announced that they had achieved  quantum supremacy   with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.    However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.

While  programmers  may depend on  probability theory  when designing a  randomized algorithm , quantum mechanical notions like superposition and  interference  are largely irrelevant for  program analysis .  Quantum programs , in contrast, rely on precise control of  coherent  quantum systems. Physicists  describe these systems mathematically  using  linear algebra .  Complex numbers  model  probability amplitudes ,  vectors  model  quantum states , and  matrices  model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of  composing   operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.  As physicist  Charlie Bennett   describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,   A classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn't be asking about ""where do quantum speedups come from?"" We should say, ""well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?"" Quantum information Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the  qubit  is the fundamental unit of  quantum information . The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states often written  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  and  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩  serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  and  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩  belong to a  vector space , meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a superposition of  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  and  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ .    A two-dimensional  vector  mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use  Dirac notation  for quantum mechanical  linear algebra , writing  ∣ ψ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } ∣ ψ ⟩  'ket  psi ' for a vector labeled  ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ψ  . Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form  α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle \alpha |0\rangle +\beta |1\rangle } α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩  , where  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  and  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩  are the standard basis states,  and  α {\displaystyle \alpha } α  and  β {\displaystyle \beta } β  are the  probability amplitudes , which are in general  complex numbers .  If either  α {\displaystyle \alpha } α  or  β {\displaystyle \beta } β  is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a  quantum state vector  acts similarly to a (classical)  probability vector , with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability amplitudes are not necessarily positive numbers.  Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.  When a qubit is  measured  in the  standard basis , the result is a classical bit. The  Born rule  describes the  norm-squared  correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities—when measuring a qubit  α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle \alpha |0\rangle +\beta |1\rangle } α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ , the state  collapses  to  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  with probability  ∣ α ∣ 2 {\displaystyle |\alpha |^{2}} ∣ α ∣ 2 , or to  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩  with probability  ∣ β ∣ 2 {\displaystyle |\beta |^{2}} ∣ β ∣ 2 . Any valid qubit state has coefficients  α {\displaystyle \alpha } α  and  β {\displaystyle \beta } β  such that  ∣ α ∣ 2 + ∣ β ∣ 2 = 1 {\displaystyle |\alpha |^{2}+|\beta |^{2}=1} ∣ α ∣ 2 + ∣ β ∣ 2 = 1 . As an example, measuring the qubit  1 / 2 ∣ 0 ⟩ + 1 / 2 ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle 1/{\sqrt {2}}|0\rangle +1/{\sqrt {2}}|1\rangle } 1 / 2 ​ ∣ 0 ⟩ + 1 / 2 ​ ∣ 1 ⟩  would produce either  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩  or  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩   with equal probability.  Each additional qubit doubles the  dimension  of the  state space .  As an example, the vector ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|01⟩ represents a two-qubit state, a  tensor product  of the qubit |0⟩ with the qubit ⁠1/√2⁠|0⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|1⟩. This vector inhabits a four-dimensional  vector space  spanned by the basis vectors |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩. The  Bell state  ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|11⟩ is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits—the two qubits are  entangled   because neither qubit has a state vector of its own. In general, the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2 -dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2  classical values.  Unitary operators The state of this one-qubit  quantum memory  can be manipulated by applying  quantum logic gates , analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with  classical logic gates . One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a  matrix   X : = ( 0 1 1 0 ) . {\displaystyle X:={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}}.} X : = ( 0 1 ​ 1 0 ​ ) .  Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with  matrix multiplication . Thus  X ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle X|0\rangle =|1\rangle } X ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 ⟩  and  X ∣ 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle X|1\rangle =|0\rangle } X ∣ 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 ⟩ . The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are  ∣ 00 ⟩ : = ( 1 0 0 0 ) ; ∣ 01 ⟩ : = ( 0 1 0 0 ) ; ∣ 10 ⟩ : = ( 0 0 1 0 ) ; ∣ 11 ⟩ : = ( 0 0 0 1 ) . {\displaystyle |00\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |01\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |10\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |11\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}.} ∣ 0 0 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 1 0 0 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 0 1 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 1 0 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 1 0 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 0 1 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 1 1 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 0 0 1 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ .  The  controlled NOT (CNOT)  gate can then be represented using the following matrix:  CNOT ⁡ : = ( 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {CNOT} :={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{pmatrix}}.} C N O T : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 1 0 0 0 ​ 0 1 0 0 ​ 0 0 0 1 ​ 0 0 1 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ .  As a mathematical consequence of this definition,  CNOT ⁡ ∣ 00 ⟩ = ∣ 00 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |00\rangle =|00\rangle } C N O T ∣ 0 0 ⟩ = ∣ 0 0 ⟩ ,  CNOT ⁡ ∣ 01 ⟩ = ∣ 01 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |01\rangle =|01\rangle } C N O T ∣ 0 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 1 ⟩ ,  CNOT ⁡ ∣ 10 ⟩ = ∣ 11 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |10\rangle =|11\rangle } C N O T ∣ 1 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 1 ⟩ , and  CNOT ⁡ ∣ 11 ⟩ = ∣ 10 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |11\rangle =|10\rangle } C N O T ∣ 1 1 ⟩ = ∣ 1 0 ⟩ . In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate ( X {\textstyle X} X  from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state  ∣ 1 ⟩ {\textstyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ . If the first qubit is  ∣ 0 ⟩ {\textstyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ , nothing is done to either qubit.

Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing  discrete logarithms , solving  Pell's equation , and more generally solving the  hidden subgroup problem  for  abelian  finite groups.  These algorithms depend on the primitive of the  quantum Fourier transform . No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely.  Certain oracle problems like  Simon's problem  and the  Bernstein–Vazirani problem  do give provable speedups, though this is in the  quantum query model , which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.  Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain  Jones polynomials , and the  quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations , have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are  BQP -complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.   Some quantum algorithms, like  Grover's algorithm  and  amplitude amplification , give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.  Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.   Simulation of quantum systems Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically,  quantum simulation  may be an important application of quantum computing.  Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a  collider .  In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.    About 2% of the annual global energy output is used for  nitrogen fixation  to produce  ammonia  for the  Haber process   in the agricultural fertilizer industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production.  It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process  by the mid-2020s  although some have predicted it will take longer.   Post-quantum cryptography A notable application of quantum computation is for  attacks  on cryptographic systems that are currently in use.  Integer factorization , which underpins the security of  public key cryptographic  systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few  prime numbers  (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).  By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to find its factors.  This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the  cryptographic  systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a  polynomial time  (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular  public key ciphers  are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the  discrete logarithm  problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the  RSA ,  Diffie–Hellman , and  elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman   algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.  Identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography.   Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the  McEliece cryptosystem  based on a problem in  coding theory .    Lattice-based cryptosystems  are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the  dihedral   hidden subgroup problem , which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem.  It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a  symmetric (secret key) algorithm  by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2  invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2  in the classical case,  meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see  Key size ).  Search problems The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of  n {\displaystyle n} n  items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using  O ( n ) {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {n}})} O ( n ​ )  queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the  Ω ( n ) {\displaystyle \Omega (n)} Ω ( n )  queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including  Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm   for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,  and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.   Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:    1. There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers, 2. The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and 3. There exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer. For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in …  See more Engineering As of 2023,  classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications.

While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.    Challenges There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.  Physicist  David DiVincenzo  has listed  these requirements   for a practical quantum computer:   • Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits • Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values • Quantum gates that are faster than  decoherence   time • Universal gate set • Qubits that can be read easily. Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult.  Superconducting quantum computers , like those constructed by  Google  and  IBM , need  helium-3 , a  nuclear  research byproduct, and special  superconducting   cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.   The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.   Decoherence One of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for  NMR  and  MRI  technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures.  Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a  dilution refrigerator  ) in order to prevent significant decoherence.  A 2020 study argues that  ionizing radiation  such as  cosmic rays   can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.   As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.   These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical  pulse shaping . Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.  As described by the  threshold theorem , if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use  quantum error correction   to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10 , assuming the noise is depolarizing.  Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L , where L is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10  bits without error correction.  With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10  bits. Computation time is about L  or about 10  steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates   show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate  for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger.  Another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a  topological quantum computer  with  anyons ,  quasi-particles  used as threads, and relying on  braid theory   to form stable logic gates.    Quantum supremacy Physicist  John Preskill   coined the term quantum supremacy to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.    The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.   In October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the  Sycamore quantum computer  more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on  Summit , generally considered the world's fastest computer.    This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed,   and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers    and even beating it.     In December 2020, a group at  USTC  implemented a type of  Boson sampling  on 76 photons with a  photonic quantum computer ,  Jiuzhang , to demonstrate quantum supremacy.    The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.   Claims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum …  See more Potential applications With focus on business management's point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.

See more Theory Computability Any  computational problem  solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.  Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using  quantum mechanics , which underlies the operation of quantum computers.   See more Computability Any  computational problem  solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.  Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using  quantum mechanics , which underlies the operation of quantum computers.  Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a  Turing machine . In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of  computability . This means that quantum computers cannot solve  undecidable problems  like the  halting problem , and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the  Church–Turing thesis .   Complexity While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently  factor integers , while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.  The class of  problems  that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called  BQP , for ""bounded error, quantum, polynomial time"". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to  BPP  (""bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time""), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time  probabilistic Turing machines  with bounded error.  It is known that  B P P ⊆ B Q P {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BPP\subseteq BQP}}} B P P ⊆ B Q P  and is widely suspected that  B Q P ⊊ B P P {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BQP\subsetneq BPP}}} B Q P ⊊ B P P , which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of  time complexity .   The exact relationship of BQP to  P ,  NP , and  PSPACE  is not known. However, it is known that  P ⊆ B Q P ⊆ P S P A C E {\displaystyle {\mathsf {P\subseteq BQP\subseteq PSPACE}}} P ⊆ B Q P ⊆ P S P A C E ; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the  discrete logarithm problem  are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that  N P ⊈ B Q P {\displaystyle {\mathsf {NP\nsubseteq BQP}}} N P ⊈ B Q P ; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of  NP-complete  problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from  NP-hardness   that all problems in NP are in BQP).
