On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves , and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer, which relies on deterministic logic and does not rely on quantum superposition and entanglement. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations ; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or ""quantum bit""), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or ""classical"" computing.  However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary ), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, a state that is in an abstract sense ""between"" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly. Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence , introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance ) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields ). In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability , and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been called "" quantum supremacy "". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited. See more History For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities. Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,   and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.

Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,   and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.  Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II ; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography ,  and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project . As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits , the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine , which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.  When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics ,  prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.    In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security . Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems , such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985,  the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm in 1993,  and Simon's algorithm in 1994.  These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition , sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism. Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie–Hellman encryption protocols,  which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.   The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,  validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture. Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.  In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,   and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates. In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.    However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched. See more Quantum information processing Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer 's operation in terms of classical electrodynamics .

Within these ""classical"" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators ) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres . While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm , quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis . Quantum programs , in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra . Complex numbers model probability amplitudes , vectors model quantum states , and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice. As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers, A classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn't be asking about ""where do quantum speedups come from?"" We should say, ""well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?"" Quantum information Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information . The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states often written ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ and ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ and ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ belong to a vector space , meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a superposition of ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ and ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ . A two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use Dirac notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra , writing ∣ ψ ⟩ {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } ∣ ψ ⟩ 'ket psi ' for a vector labeled ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ψ . Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle \alpha |0\rangle +\beta |1\rangle } α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ , where ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ and ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ are the standard basis states,  and α {\displaystyle \alpha } α and β {\displaystyle \beta } β are the probability amplitudes , which are in general complex numbers .  If either α {\displaystyle \alpha } α or β {\displaystyle \beta } β is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a quantum state vector acts similarly to a (classical) probability vector , with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability amplitudes are not necessarily positive numbers.  Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference. When a qubit is measured in the standard basis , the result is a classical bit. The Born rule describes the norm-squared correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities—when measuring a qubit α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle \alpha |0\rangle +\beta |1\rangle } α ∣ 0 ⟩ + β ∣ 1 ⟩ , the state collapses to ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ with probability ∣ α ∣ 2 {\displaystyle |\alpha |^{2}} ∣ α ∣ 2 , or to ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ with probability ∣ β ∣ 2 {\displaystyle |\beta |^{2}} ∣ β ∣ 2 . Any valid qubit state has coefficients α {\displaystyle \alpha } α and β {\displaystyle \beta } β such that ∣ α ∣ 2 + ∣ β ∣ 2 = 1 {\displaystyle |\alpha |^{2}+|\beta |^{2}=1} ∣ α ∣ 2 + ∣ β ∣ 2 = 1 . As an example, measuring the qubit 1 / 2 ∣ 0 ⟩ + 1 / 2 ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle 1/{\sqrt {2}}|0\rangle +1/{\sqrt {2}}|1\rangle } 1 / 2 ​ ∣ 0 ⟩ + 1 / 2 ​ ∣ 1 ⟩ would produce either ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ or ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ with equal probability. Each additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space .  As an example, the vector ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|01⟩ represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit |0⟩ with the qubit ⁠1/√2⁠|0⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|1⟩. This vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩. The Bell state ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|11⟩ is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits—the two qubits are entangled because neither qubit has a state vector of its own. In general, the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2 -dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2  classical values. Unitary operators The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates , analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates . One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix X : = ( 0 1 1 0 ) . {\displaystyle X:={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}}.} X : = ( 0 1 ​ 1 0 ​ ) . Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with matrix multiplication . Thus X ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 ⟩ {\displaystyle X|0\rangle =|1\rangle } X ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 ⟩ and X ∣ 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 ⟩ {\displaystyle X|1\rangle =|0\rangle } X ∣ 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 ⟩ . The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are ∣ 00 ⟩ : = ( 1 0 0 0 ) ; ∣ 01 ⟩ : = ( 0 1 0 0 ) ; ∣ 10 ⟩ : = ( 0 0 1 0 ) ; ∣ 11 ⟩ : = ( 0 0 0 1 ) . {\displaystyle |00\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |01\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |10\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}};\quad |11\rangle :={\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}.} ∣ 0 0 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 1 0 0 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 0 1 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 1 0 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 1 0 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 0 1 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ ; ∣ 1 1 ⟩ : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 0 0 0 1 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ . The controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix: CNOT ⁡ : = ( 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {CNOT} :={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{pmatrix}}.} C N O T : = ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎛ ​ 1 0 0 0 ​ 0 1 0 0 ​ 0 0 0 1 ​ 0 0 1 0 ​ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎞ ​ . As a mathematical consequence of this definition, CNOT ⁡ ∣ 00 ⟩ = ∣ 00 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |00\rangle =|00\rangle } C N O T ∣ 0 0 ⟩ = ∣ 0 0 ⟩ , CNOT ⁡ ∣ 01 ⟩ = ∣ 01 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |01\rangle =|01\rangle } C N O T ∣ 0 1 ⟩ = ∣ 0 1 ⟩ , CNOT ⁡ ∣ 10 ⟩ = ∣ 11 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |10\rangle =|11\rangle } C N O T ∣ 1 0 ⟩ = ∣ 1 1 ⟩ , and CNOT ⁡ ∣ 11 ⟩ = ∣ 10 ⟩ {\textstyle \operatorname {CNOT} |11\rangle =|10\rangle } C N O T ∣ 1 1 ⟩ = ∣ 1 0 ⟩ . In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate ( X {\textstyle X} X from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state ∣ 1 ⟩ {\textstyle |1\rangle } ∣ 1 ⟩ . If the first qubit is ∣ 0 ⟩ {\textstyle |0\rangle } ∣ 0 ⟩ , nothing is done to either qubit.

Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing . See more Algorithms Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.

Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms. Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms , solving Pell's equation , and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups.  These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform . No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely.  Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model , which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems. Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials , and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations , have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP -complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely. Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification , give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.  Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems. Simulation of quantum systems Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing.  Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider .  In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer. About 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertilizer industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production.  It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process  by the mid-2020s  although some have predicted it will take longer. Post-quantum cryptography A notable application of quantum computation is for attacks on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. Integer factorization , which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).  By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to find its factors.  This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the RSA , Diffie–Hellman , and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security. Identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography.   Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory . Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem , which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem.  It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2  invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2  in the classical case,  meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size ). Search problems The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of n {\displaystyle n} n items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using O ( n ) {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {n}})} O ( n ​ ) queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the Ω ( n ) {\displaystyle \Omega (n)} Ω ( n ) queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,  and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees. Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties: 1. There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers, 2. The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and 3. There exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer. For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in … See more Engineering As of 2023,  classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications.

While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain. Challenges There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.  Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer: • Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits • Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values • Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time • Universal gate set • Qubits that can be read easily. Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Superconducting quantum computers , like those constructed by Google and IBM , need helium-3 , a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co. The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge. Decoherence One of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures.  Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator ) in order to prevent significant decoherence.  A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds. As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions. These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping . Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time. As described by the threshold theorem , if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10 , assuming the noise is depolarizing. Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L , where L is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10  bits without error correction.  With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10  bits. Computation time is about L  or about 10  steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates   show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate  for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger. Another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons , quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.   Non-Abelian anyons can, in effect, remember how they have been manipulated, making the potentially useful in quantum computing.  As of 2025, Microsoft and other organizations are investing in quasi-particle research. Quantum supremacy Physicist John Preskill coined the term quantum supremacy to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.    The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark. In October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit , generally considered the world's fastest computer.    This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed,   and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers    and even beating it. In December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer , Jiuzhang , to demonstrate quantum supremacy.
