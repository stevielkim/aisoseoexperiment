##Understanding Importance of Content Optimization For SEO vs AISO rankings 
*Content stand-off between SEO and AISO - does it really matter if you optimize for one vs the other?*

This in-progress project compares traditional SEO search results with AI-generated answers from Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot. 

###Goal
Run an experiment to discover if the same content is prioritized by traditional search engines vs AI search engines/overviews,
so we as product and marketing professionals understand if it's critical to rewrite content to optimize for AISO.


It includes a modular scraping pipeline built with Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup
to collect and analyze how different types of content are represented in modern AI search experiences.

Features:

- Scrapes organic results + AI Overviews
- Handles “Show more” interactions in AI summaries
- Stores structured data in JSON/CSV formats
- Designed for experimentation with AI Search Optimization (AISO)
- Use this repo to explore how content surfaces in AI-driven search and track changes over time.
