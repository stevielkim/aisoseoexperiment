This in-progress project compares traditional SEO search results with AI-generated answers from Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot. 
It includes a modular scraping pipeline built with Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup
to collect and analyze how different types of content are represented in modern AI search experiences.

Features:

Scrapes organic results + AI Overviews
Handles “Show more” interactions in AI summaries
Stores structured data in JSON/CSV formats
Designed for experimentation with AI Search Optimization (AISO)
Use this repo to explore how content surfaces in AI-driven search and track changes over time.
