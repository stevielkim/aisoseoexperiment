Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said something that made a lot of people pause:

""We used to tell people that everyone should learn how to program. Now it’s our job to build technology so no one has to.""

On the surface, it sounds like coding no longer matters. That computer science is “obsolete.” 

But that is not true.

The reality is that the definition of programming has changed. 

Coding is no longer just writing for-loops in Python. It is about problem-solving, system design, and using the tools at your disposal, including AI, to build solutions. 

So should you still learn to code? Absolutely.

Here is why:
- Coding teaches you logic, problem-solving, and structured thinking.
- It gives you the foundation to understand how AI systems work.
- It lets you go from being an AI consumer to a creator.

So yes, it is still worth learning to code in 2025. But do not stop at syntax. Learn how to engineer, how to apply technology, and how to leverage AI as an amplifier.

The future is not “no coding.”

The future is coding powered by AI.

The current study aimed to compare the effects of a mindfulness intervention with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on measures of emotional distress and attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment among older adults. Twenty-four seniors were assigned to three groups: (1) Mindfulness-based intervention for seniors (MBIS), (2) CBT for anxiety, or (3) a care-as-usual control group. Participants in the two intervention groups of eight weekly sessions were randomly assigned. Results showed that attitudes toward seeking psychological treatment and depression, anxiety, and worry levels were evaluated before and after the interventions. Following both interventions, participants considered the prospect of utilizing psychological treatment more positively, whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Interestingly, worry levels were eased only in the MBIS group, and anxiety levels were eased only in the CBT group. Our findings support the understanding that cognitive group interventions can effectively achieve their intended aim (decreasing worry or anxiety) and positively impact attitudes toward psychological treatment.
